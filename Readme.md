# Action Detection

This project implements an action detection model using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It leverages machine learning techniques to recognize and classify human actions in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time action detection and classification.
- Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model training and evaluation.
- Employs OpenCV and MediaPipe for video processing and feature extraction.

## Requirements

The project requires the following dependencies:

```bash
numpy
cv2 (OpenCV)
mediapipe
tensorflow
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```

# Installation
1. Clone the Repositery:
```git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

# 2. Install dependencies:
```pip install numpy opencv-python mediapipe tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn```


# 3. Download or prepare your dataset.
Usage:
1. Run the notebook or script to preprocess data and train the model.
2. Test the action detection using live video feed or pre-recorded videos.
3. Analyze the model's performance with accuracy scores and confusion matrices.
